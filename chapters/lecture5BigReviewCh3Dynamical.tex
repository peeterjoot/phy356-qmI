\section{Lecture notes: Review}

For
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lecture5BigReviewCh3Dynamical:20}
\ket{\phi} = \int dk f(k) \ket{k}
\end{equation}

How do we find \(\ket{\phi(t)}\), the time evolved state?  Here we have the option of choosing which of the pictures (Schr\"{o}dinger, Heisenberg, interaction) we deal with.  Since the \textAndIndex{Heisenberg picture} deals with time evolved operators, and the interaction picture with evolving Hamiltonians, neither of these is required to answer this question.  Consider the \textAndIndex{Schr\"{o}dinger picture} which gives

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lecture5BigReviewCh3Dynamical:40}
\ket{\phi(t)} = \int dk f(k) \ket{k} e^{-i E_k t/\Hbar}
\end{equation}

where \(E_k\) is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator \(H\).

%STRONG SEEMING HINT: If looking for additional problems and homework, consider in detail the time evolution of the Gaussian wave packet state.

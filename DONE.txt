   - flatten chapter sections.

   - move the exam prep stuff to appropriate places in their chapters.

   - have \paragraph{\texorpdfstring messes that I suspect were once \subsections.  Those can be cleaned up.

   - has no indexing at all.  indexing added up to but not including chapter 12 (rotation and a.m)

   - places to use makeexample (paragraph.*problem?)
